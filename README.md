# BI-COPD Diagnostic App -iOS

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is one of the leading causes of deaths world wide, this app aims at providing an early diagnostic phase to get patients to doctors/treatment earlier in an effort to improve the quality of the patients life. **_for Boehringer Ingelheim_**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to build and deploy the project.

### Coding Standard

Ensure you review the medullan [Coding Standards for Swift](https://github.com/cbeckner/CodeGuidelines/tree/master/docs/language%20specific/Swift) before you start coding.

### Prerequisites

The following are prerequisites for the application:
- [Xcode 8](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Swift 3](https://swift.org/)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Installing


Clone the git repo (https)

```
git clone https://github.com/medullan/bicopd-diagnostic-app-ios.git bi-diagnostic-ios
```

**OR**

Clone the git repo (ssh)
```
git clone git@github.com:medullan/bicopd-diagnostic-app-ios.git bi-diagnostic-ios
```
Navigate to diagnostic app
```
cd bi-diagnostic-ios
```

Install dependencies

```

Open the BI-Diagnostic.xcworkspace file inside the bi-diagnostic-ios folder and you are ready to go.

## Tests

This project uses behavior-driven development (BDD) more specifically the [Quick Framework](https://github.com/Quick/Quick). You are expected to have the following tests where applicable for your User Stories. **Tests are expected to be written as you code.**

Circle CI will be testing your application on each commit to ensure the standards are being met. The code coverage metrics are **TBD** but are coming soon.
